## Preparation 0: Retrieving the Application Front-end

## 🎯 Objective

Retrieve the source code of the CBSA application's front-end part from GitHub and prepare the workspace for the lab.

### 🔧 Bob Mode to Use

**Mode: 💻 Code**

Code mode allows executing system commands and manipulating files.

### 📝 Context

Before starting the analysis, you need to retrieve the CBSA application source code from the official GitHub repository. We will use Bob to automate this preparation. 
Open Bob, click on the **File>Open Folder** menu and choose the ~/CBSA directory.


### 💬 Bob Prompt 

```
Retrieve the directories named "src/bank-application-frontend", "src/webui", "src/Z-OS-Connect-Customer-Services-Interface", "src/Z-OS-Connect-Payment-Interface", "src/Z-OS-Connect-Payment-Interface", and "src/zosconnect_artefacts" from the GitHub repository https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-banking-sample-application-cbsa.git and place them in this workspace.
```

### ✅ Expected Result 

Bob executes the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository into a temporary directory
rm -rf /tmp/cbsa-temp && git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-banking-sample-application-cbsa.git /tmp/cbsa-temp
cd /tmp/cbsa-temp && git sparse-checkout set src/bank-application-frontend src/webui src/Z-OS-Connect-Customer-Services-Interface src/Z-OS-Connect-Payment-Interface src/zosconnect_artefacts

mkdir -p ./src && cp -r /tmp/cbsa-temp/src/bank-application-frontend /tmp/cbsa-temp/src/webui /tmp/cbsa-temp/src/Z-OS-Connect-Customer-Services-Interface /tmp/cbsa-temp/src/Z-OS-Connect-Payment-Interface /tmp/cbsa-temp/src/zosconnect_artefacts ./src/

```

**Console output**:
```
The following 5 directories have been retrieved from the GitHub repository and placed in the workspace:
1.	bank-application-frontend/ - Banking frontend application
2.	webui/ - Web user interface
3.	Z-OS-Connect-Customer-Services-Interface/ - z/OS Connect interface for customer services
4.	Z-OS-Connect-Payment-Interface/ - z/OS Connect interface for payments
5.	zosconnect_artefacts/ - z/OS Connect artifacts


```



### 🎓 What You Learn

- **Automation**: Bob can execute Git and system commands
- **Workspace preparation**: Bob can organize files for the lab
- **Verification**: Bob can validate that everything is in place
- **Time savings**: 5 minutes instead of 15-20 minutes manually

- ✅ **Use French**: Bob is configured to respond in French
- ✅ **One task at a time**: Don't combine multiple complex requests

### 2. Mode Usage
- 🧰 **Z Code**: For all mainframe analyses and documentation generation
- 📐 **Z Architect**: For architecture and design analyses (not used in this lab)
- ❓ **Ask**: For questions without code modification

### 3. Result Validation
- ✅ Always verify that files are created
- ✅ Open files to validate their content
- ✅ Test Draw.io diagrams in the editor
- ✅ Read Bob's explanations to understand the context

### 4. Time Management
- ⏱️ Follow the estimated times for each exercise
- ⏱️ Take breaks between long exercises
- ⏱️ Don't hesitate to ask Bob for clarifications

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Bob doesn't respond
**Solution:** Verify that you are in Z Code mode and that the project is open in VSCode

### Problem: The file is not created
**Solution:** Check write permissions and available disk space

### Problem: The Draw.io diagram doesn't open
**Solution:** Install the Draw.io Integration extension in VSCode

### Problem: Bob generates content in English
**Solution:** Remind Bob: "Please respond in French"
